# Skill Development through Coding Exercise

This coding exercise enhances several key skills:

## 1. State Management
- **Description**: The code manages the state of buttons (whether each button is selected or not). This skill is crucial for many web development and programming projects, especially for interactive applications and forms.
- **Enhanced Skill**: Ability to track and update the state of various objects and manage different states of a user interface.

## 2. Logic and Algorithms
- **Description**: The code involves algorithms to check button states and validate configurations. It requires using conditions, loops, and comparisons.
- **Enhanced Skill**: Ability to design and implement logical algorithms and analyze various conditions to achieve a result.

## 3. DOM (Document Object Model) Interaction
- **Description**: The code changes button colors and text, and manages click events using DOM methods.
- **Enhanced Skill**: Ability to use DOM APIs for dynamically altering content and styling of page elements.

## 4. CSS Styling
- **Description**: CSS styles are applied inline and through CSS classes. This skill is important for designing user interfaces and adapting them to specific needs.
- **Enhanced Skill**: Ability to use CSS effectively for design and styling.

## 7. Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
- **Description**: Using objects to manage button states demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming principles.
- **Enhanced Skill**: Ability to model data and states using objects.
